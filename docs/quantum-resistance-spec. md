# Greyvault SQRP Technical Specification

## Overview
Greyvault’s Self-Evolving Quantum Resistance Protocol (SQRP) is a cryptographic framework designed for autonomous aerospace systems, especially satellites. Unlike static encryption, SQRP evolves its own protocol parameters over time using fitness-based mutation logic. This approach maintains DO-178C compliance while achieving measurable quantum resistance against Grover and Shor-class attacks.

## Objectives
- Achieve >90% resistance to quantum decryption attempts
- Maintain aerospace-grade compliance (DO-178C Level B)
- Operate autonomously without ground-based key rotation
- Establish cryptographic diversity across satellite constellations

## Core Components
- **Mutation Engine:** Applies probabilistic changes to protocol traits (key size, entropy source, cipher suite)
- **Fitness Evaluator:** Scores protocol variants based on entropy, mutation history, and simulated quantum attack models
- **Protocol Genome:** Encoded representation of cryptographic traits (64-bit vector)
- **Evolution Cycle:** Triggered by entropy drift, time intervals, or anomaly detection
