**Greyvault Announces Self-Evolving Quantum Resistance Protocol for Satellites**

KINSTON, NC — Greyvault has unveiled SQRP, a breakthrough in autonomous encryption for aerospace systems. Unlike static cryptographic protocols, SQRP evolves its own parameters using fitness-based mutation logic, achieving up to 95% quantum resistance while maintaining DO-178C compliance.

Founder Deonate Sutton explains:  
*"We built SQRP to survive the quantum era. It adapts, mutates, and strengthens itself—without ground control."*

The technology is patent pending and publicly timestamped via GitHub and CodePen. A visual demonstration and technical specification are now available.
