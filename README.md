🛡️ Greyvault: Evolutionary Quantum-Resistant Security Protocol (SQRP)

From $1.34M Lost to Sovereign Defense

In 2025, Lenoir County lost $1.34M to payment fraud. Greyvault was born from that breach—not as a reaction, but as a revolution.

SQRP isn’t just quantum-resistant. It evolves.
Using genetic algorithms, our protocol adapts in real time, mutating its defenses with every threat.

🎯 Why It Matters

Traditional cybersecurity is static.
Attackers evolve.
Greyvault mutates.

Every breach attempt strengthens the protocol.
Every threat becomes training data.
Every partner becomes a sovereign actor.
