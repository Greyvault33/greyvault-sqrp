Greyvault: Where HBCUs Become Intelligence Suppliers

The Architect’s Vision

What began as quantum defense consulting evolved into something greater: a sovereign intelligence marketplace where universities don’t just consume security—they supply it.



The Stack:

• Quantum-resistant cryptographic watermarking
• Evolutionary honeypot architecture
• Threat intelligence capture & monetization engine
• Revenue-sharing dashboard for institutional partners


The Movement

We’re not building another security tool. We’re architecting digital sovereignty—where HBCUs and community institutions become first-class participants in the $500B cybersecurity economy.

For HBCUs: Transform from targets to suppliers. Your threat data becomes revenue.

For Investors: The NASDAQ of threat intelligence starts here.

For Communities: Digital literacy workshops launching in Kinston, NC—because sovereignty begins at home.
