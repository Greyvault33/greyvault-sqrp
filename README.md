Greyvault: Evolutionary Quantum-Resistant Security Protocol (SQRP)

🛡️ Preventing the Next Million-Dollar Breach

After Lenoir County lost $1.34M to payment fraud in 2025, we built the solution. Greyvault’s SQRP doesn’t just resist quantum attacks—it evolves against them in real-time.

Watch as:

• Genetic algorithms adapt to attack patterns
• Fitness scores climb through natural selection
• Quantum resistance evolves before your eyes


🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional cybersecurity is static. Attackers evolve—why shouldn’t defenses? Our protocol mutates and adapts, creating unpredictable resistance patterns that make breaches exponentially harder with each attempt.

🤝 Partnership Opportunities

For Universities: Turn this vision into reality through student projects and research grants.

For Municipalities: Protect your infrastructure with protocols that learn from every threat.

For Investors: Join the movement making cybersecurity evolutionary, not reactionary.
