🛡️ Greyvault: Quantum-Resistant Security Protocol (SQRP)

From $1.34M Lost to Sovereign Defense

In 2025, Lenoir County lost $1.34M to payment fraud. Greyvault was architected in response—not as a patch, but as a paradigm shift.

SQRP is engineered to resist quantum-level threats using adaptive cryptographic strategies and intelligence capture.
It’s not reactive. It’s anticipatory.

🎯 Why It Matters

Traditional cybersecurity is predictable.
Greyvault is not.

Every intrusion attempt becomes a data point.
Every deployment strengthens the network.
Every partner becomes a sovereign actor in the intelligence economy.
